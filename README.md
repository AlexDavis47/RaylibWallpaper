# Raylib Wallpaper
This is an incredibly buggy and quickly thrown together program, created to test the possibility of rendering a RayLib program on the user's desktop *behind* the UI components, aka, a moving wallpaper.
Unfortunately, testing showed that Windows had made recent changes which broke this functionality at the time, though it may work on the latest updates.
